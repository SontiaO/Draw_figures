# Draw_figures
## About
This is a small university project, an example of simple drawing software. You can draw recktangles, elipses, polygons and curves, by entering coordinates manually or directly on the canvas.
You can save your picture using the .bmp format, and you can use .txt files with coordinates and .xml files with all the figures both for saving and uploading pictures
